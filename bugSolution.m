To mitigate precision issues with `NSDecimalNumber`, consider the following improvements:

1. **Use `NSDecimalNumberHandler`:** Employ `NSDecimalNumberHandler` to explicitly control rounding behavior during calculations. Specify the rounding mode, scale, and other parameters to minimize precision loss.
2. **Check for Equality with Tolerance:** Instead of directly comparing `NSDecimalNumber` objects using `isEqual:` which might fail due to slight precision differences, introduce a tolerance value. Check if the absolute difference between the two numbers is within the acceptable tolerance.
3. **Scale Numbers:** Before performing calculations involving significantly different magnitudes, scale the numbers to a common scale to reduce the impact of rounding errors. 

Example of improved calculation using `NSDecimalNumberHandler`:

```objectivec
NSDecimalNumberHandler *handler = [NSDecimalNumberHandler decimalNumberHandlerWithRoundingMode:NSRoundPlain scale:10 raiseOnExactness:NO raiseOnOverflow:NO raiseOnUnderflow:NO raiseOnDivideByZero:YES];

NSDecimalNumber *largeNumber = [NSDecimalNumber decimalNumberWithString:@
